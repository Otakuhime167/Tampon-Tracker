## Detailed Functionality
The Tampon Tracker is intended for women who use tampons on their periods. 
Tampons that are left in for over 8 hours encourages bacteria growth and increases chances of 
[Toxic Shock Syndrome](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/toxic-shock-syndrome-tss). 
However, currently it is difficult to conveniently manage and track tampon usage in our busy lives. Therefore, 
the Tampon Tracker App provides a easy to use and user-friendly way that encourages users to track their tampon 
usage, and will notify users when it's time to change their tampons.

The Tampon Tracker App provides the following functionalities:
- **Timer**: Users can start, reset, and manage a timer that tracks tampon usage duration.
- **Progress Visualization**: A circular progress bar visually indicates the remaining time until the next change.
- **User Interactions**: Users can easily toggle between "Insert" and "Take Out" buttons to manage usage.
- **Notifications**: Users will be notified when it is about time to change their tampons.

## Development Process
I planned the UI and design of the app, and told the AI step by step what I wanted. The AI gave me code for implementing
the features that I mentioned. When I encountered bugs, I would give AI the error messages and it helped me fix them.
